## Hudson and Jenkins

Jenkins and Hudson are, at the time of writing, extremely similar, and almost all of the techniques discussed in this book will apply equally well for both products. Differences are likely to be minor. For conformity's sake, we will use the term 'Jenkins' throughout the book to refer to the tool in question. In short, whenever we say "Jenkins", what we really mean is "Jenkins and Hudson". Any features that are truly Jenkins-specific The illustrations in this book come from various versions of Hudson/Jenkins, and either before the fork in January 2011 (in which case they will have the old Hudson logo), or after this date (in which case they will generally have been taken with Jenkins).
