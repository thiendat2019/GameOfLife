  <para>The animal on the cover of <emphasis>Jenkins: The Definitive
  Guide</emphasis> is an ornate chorus frog (<emphasis>Pseudacris
  ornata</emphasis>). These small amphibians, only 1–1.5 inches long, can be
  found on the coastal plains of North America from North Carolina to central
  Florida and eastern Louisiana. They prefer areas of shallow water without
  dense vegetation, such as ponds, roadside ditches, and flooded
  meadows.</para>
  <para>The coloration of ornate chorus frogs varies depending on locale, and
  individuals can be predominantly black, white, brown, red, green, or some
  variation thereof. All specimens, though, display a dark stripe or
  collection of spots running from the nostril to the shoulder through the
  eye, and most have various other spots or stripes as well. The species
  breeds from November to March, and the calls of males can be heard from in
  or near areas of shallow water.</para>
  <para>Ornate chorus frogs also owe their name to the sound of their mating
  call: <emphasis>Pseudacris</emphasis> comes from the ancient Greek for
  “false locust.” The name was assigned in 1836 by American naturalist John
  Edwards Holbrook after he observed that the rapid shrill sound resembled
  that made by the infamous insect.</para>
